ACID properties are fundamental principles that ensure reliable and secure transactions, 
even in complex scenarios such as online shopping:

1. Atomicity: In an online shopping scenario, atomicity guarantees that actions like adding 
items to a cart either fully succeed or fail altogether. If any part of the process encounters 
an issue, such as an item being out of stock, the entire transaction is canceled to prevent incomplete orders.

2. Consistency: Consistency ensures that transactions abide by predefined rules. For instance, 
if customers are restricted from placing orders exceeding their credit limit, consistency checks ensure this 
rule is enforced before finalizing the transaction. Orders violating such rules are declined to maintain consistency
and prevent overspending.

3. Isolation: In situations where multiple customers are making purchases simultaneously, isolation ensures that 
each transaction remains independent of others. Even when transactions occur concurrently, they shouldn't interfere with
each other. For example, one customer's actions, like browsing or purchasing items, should not impact another customer's experience.

4. Durability: Once a customer completes a purchase and the payment is processed, the associated order details must be 
reliably stored permanently. Durability ensures that transaction data remains intact and accessible, even in the event of 
system failures. This guarantees that customers can access their order history, and the store maintains accurate records regardless of any technical challenges.

In summary, applying ACID properties to an online shopping context ensures the reliability and security of transactions 
by guaranteeing atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability throughout the process.
